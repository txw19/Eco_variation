# Eco_variation
Data processing script and code for conducting analyses in Soranno et al. - Spatial and temporal variation of ecosystem properties at macroscales

Files: 
TP_full_model.R fits a hierarchical models with a horseshoe prior on regression parameters for total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in inland lakes. This script uses the data file TP_full_data.rds

TP_unconditional_model.R fits a variance partitioning model for TP in inland lakes. This script uses the data file TP_unconditional.rds

Climate_data_processing.R and lagos_data_processing.R are scripts showing how both the climate data and LAGOSNE data were processes prior to analysis.
